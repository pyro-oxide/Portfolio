      "During my internship at EisenVault, a leading Document Management System provider in India, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack web development. The internship provided a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies crucial for modern web applications. I learned the core principles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to design responsive and user-friendly web interfaces. On the backend, I was introduced to MySQL, where I worked on setting up and managing databases essential for storing and retrieving document metadata securely and efficiently. As part of the practical training, I participated in building a basic web application, which included structuring content with HTML, styling with CSS, adding interactivity using JavaScript, and connecting it to a MySQL database to simulate real-world document storage and retrieval operations. The experience deepened my understanding of how secure document management systems function and gave me valuable insight into professional software development workflows.",
